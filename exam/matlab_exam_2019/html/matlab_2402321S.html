<span class="comment">% You work for the Glasgow City Council and are responsible for analysing data that</span>
<span class="comment">% has been recorded by a CCTV camera in the city centre. This CCTV camera has filmed</span>
<span class="comment">% a short section of Sauchiehall Street. The council wants to estimate how many</span>
<span class="comment">% people pass through this section to understand how busy this part of the city</span>
<span class="comment">% centre is. Using this knowledge, the council will then decide which parts of</span>
<span class="comment">% the city centre should be invested in for pedestrian use.</span>
<span class="comment">% You have been given a CCTV recording of 1 minute (recorded at 25 frames per second)</span>
<span class="comment">% to analyse. This CCTV-recorded data has already been processed by a software that</span>
<span class="comment">% detects people. The output of this software is a series of single frames (i.e.,</span>
<span class="comment">% static images) where positive integers in each frame indicate that a human has</span>
<span class="comment">% been detected. Within a given frame, each detected human has been assigned a</span>
<span class="comment">% unique positive integer (e.g., 4). However, the human detection software cannot</span>
<span class="comment">% connect consecutive frames. This means that the same person can be assigned a</span>
<span class="comment">% different number across different frames (e.g., 1 in one frame, but 5 in the next</span>
<span class="comment">% frame), which makes counting the number of people who have passed through this</span>
<span class="comment">% section problematic.</span>
<span class="comment">% Your task is to resolve this problem by applying a simple heuristic (details</span>
<span class="comment">% provided below) so that each person detected keeps the same identifier across</span>
<span class="comment">% frames.</span>

% You work for the Glasgow City Council and are responsible for analysing data that 
% has been recorded by a CCTV camera in the city centre. This CCTV camera has filmed 
% a short section of Sauchiehall Street. The council wants to estimate how many 
% people pass through this section to understand how busy this part of the city
% centre is. Using this knowledge, the council will then decide which parts of 
% the city centre should be invested in for pedestrian use.
% You have been given a CCTV recording of 1 minute (recorded at 25 frames per second)
% to analyse. This CCTV-recorded data has already been processed by a software that 
% detects people. The output of this software is a series of single frames (i.e., 
% static images) where positive integers in each frame indicate that a human has 
% been detected. Within a given frame, each detected human has been assigned a 
% unique positive integer (e.g., 4). However, the human detection software cannot 
% connect consecutive frames. This means that the same person can be assigned a 
% different number across different frames (e.g., 1 in one frame, but 5 in the next 
% frame), which makes counting the number of people who have passed through this 
% section problematic.
% Your task is to resolve this problem by applying a simple heuristic (details 
% provided below) so that each person detected keeps the same identifier across
% frames.
% Data files
% You have been given a folder which contains the following:
% 1. imagesList.mat This file contains a list of the image filenames recorded by
% the CCTV.
% 2. imageFiles,afoldercontaining.pngfiles.Thesearetheimagefilesrecorded
% by the CCTV. The second number in the file names indicates the temporal
% order of the images starting at C0039_100000_INDS.png, i.e frame number 100000
% is the first image).

% I am not entirely sure what the histogram should be.

%% 

% Q4 (4 points)
% Your task is to estimate how many people walked through this section of the city 
% centre during the recording. However, in each frame, each detected person has been 
% assigned a unique number, which makes this estimation problematic. Your job now is
% to infer whether, in consecutive frames, a given identifier represents the same 
% person or a different person.

% To address this problem, calculate the amount of overlap between pixels that 
% identify a given person in one frame and the pixels that identify a given person
% in the previous frame (i.e., how many pixels of person with ID number 4 in frame 2
% overlap with the person with ID number 5 in frame 1?). If there is high overlap 
% between detected persons, this likely indicates that these are in fact the same 
% person. Divide this amount by the number of pixels that the respective person 
% occupies in the current frame (i.e., calculate the percentage of pixels that
% overlap). Calculate this  value for all pairs of consecutive frames 
% ([1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4] ...) and for all detected persons. Display the pooled 
% results as a histogram using 100 bins. Crop the figures on the y-axis so 
% that you can better see the shape of the distribution and to ignore most 
% of the entries for the lowest bin.

%% keep track of each person in a frame, for the next frame see if any of
%% those people are over threshold.

% store all of our comparisons in here.

% Q5 (6 points)

% Next, you must decide whether each person detected in each frame corresponds to the
% same person in the neighbouring frame, or if it's a different person. To do this, 
% choose a cut-off value that roughly divides the histogram created in Q4 in two 
% (don?t worry ? your choice of cut-off value will not be marked but do make sure 
% that the cut- off is sensible). Now, for each pair of consecutive frames and for 
% each detected person in each frame, identify any persons in the preceding frame 
% whose level of pixel overlap exceeds that threshold. For any such persons, assign 
% the identity of the corresponding person in the previous frame to the person in 
% the current frame.

% Next, assume that a person cannot walk through this section of the city centre in 
% less than 3 seconds. Using this rule, treat all identified persons that appear to
% pass through this section in less than 3 seconds as noise and remove them.
% Display your results in a figure as a matrix where the x-axis corresponds to time 
% in seconds and the y-axis corresponds to unique persons. The appearance of each 
% person across time (i.e., across frames) will be represented as a 1 in the matrix,
% all other values as 0. Use the colormap ?gray?. Add to the title the final inferred 
% number of persons that have passed through this section of the city centre, the 
% mean time needed to pass through this section and its standard deviation.
% Finally, display a line plot showing the total number of persons that passed 
% through this section of the city centre at each time point. Use a thick red line.
% Use solid green circles to mark each time point. Add meaningful x- and y-axis 
% labels and a title.
